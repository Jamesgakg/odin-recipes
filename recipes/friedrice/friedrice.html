    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fried Rice is a rice dish originating from China, is it commonly served as a way to use leftover rice and whatever other ingredients are lying around consisting of aromatics, vegetables and protien all fried in a wok.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (2 servings)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>fresh Garlic</li>
        <li>fresh Chilli</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>

        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>baby carrots</li>
        <li>300g Chicken Thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Thinly slice fresh Chilli</li>
        <li>Grate, thinly slice or mince (based on personal preference) 2 large cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>Weigh out 2 cups of cooked Rice (it is best to use 1 or 2 day old cooked rice because it has "dried" out and will absorb the flavours)</li>
        <li>Slice up baby carrots</li>
        <li>Weigh out 1/2 cup of frozen Green Peas</li>
        <li>Crack 2 eggs into a bowl, add some salt and wisk them</li>
        <li>Dice up chicken thighs into small bite size pieces</li>
        <li>Weigh up 2 separate servings of 10g of Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Weigh 15g of soy sauce</li>
        <li>Grab a Wok, place it on the stove and turn the heat up to the highest setting</li>
        <li>Its very important here to be fully prepped with ingredients, utensils and equipment before proceeding as this dish goes together very quickly</li>
        <li>As soon as the wok starts to smoke a little, add 1 of the 10g servings of Sesame oil into the wok</li>
        <li>As soon as the oil starts to smoke, add the aromatics (chilli and garlic) and cook them for 15-25 seconds to release the flavour</li>
        <li>Throw in the diced up Chicken Thighs, lightly season with salt then mix with the aromatics using a stainless steel wok spatula</li>
        <li>Cook the Chicken Thighs untill its fully cooked through (the smaller the chicken has been diced, the quicker it will cook)</li>
        <li>Remove cooked Chicken Thighs from the wok while leaving the excess fat/oil in the wok and place cooked chicken into a small bowl and set aside</li>
        <li>Let the excess fat/oil in the wok heat up and smoke again</li>
        <li>Add sliced baby carrots, add frozen Green peas then season with salt</li>
        <li>Saute' baby carrots and Green peas until they are semi-cooked</li>
        <li>Remove baby carrots and Green peas from wok and place into a small bowl</li>
        <li>Add the 2nd 10g serving of Sesame oil into the wok, let the wok heat up again until the oil starts to smoke</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the wok then immediately throw the cooked Rice into the wok</li>
        <li>Mix, stir the eggs and rice together thoroughly using a stainless steel wok spatula</li>
        <li>Add the cooked Chicken thighs into the wok, add the saute'd baby carrots and Green peas into the wok</li>
        <li>Add the 15g serving of soy sauce into the wok then stir and mix it all together</li>
        <li>Turn heat off, continue stiring</li>
        <li>Finally use a teaspoon to taste the dish and sparingly add aditional soy sauce then stir untill desired flavour is achived</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
