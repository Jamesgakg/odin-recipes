    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Carbonara is a pasta dish originating from Rome, typically consisting of spaghetti (or some variant) mixed with pork, cheese, eggs and black pepper.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (2 servings)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g Spaghetti or Spagettoni</li>
        <li>3 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>100g Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>100g Guanciale (cured pork cheek)</li>
        <li>fresh ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large cooking pot with water, place pot on stove and bring too the boil</li>
        <li>Add a "three finger" pinch of rock salt to the water</li>
        <li>Slice Guanciale into thin strips roughly 1" or 25mm long</li>
        <li>Grab a large skillet, place skillet onto stove and turn heat to medium</li>
        <li>Lay strips of Guanciale into skillet</li>
        <li>Add spaghetti to boiling cooking pot and cook according to instructions indicated on packet</li>
        <li>Grab a medium sized bowl</li>
        <li>Crack 3 whole eggs into the bowl</li>
        <li>Crack 1 egg, separate the white from the yolk and place <em>yolk</em> into bowl with the other 3 whole eggs</li>
        <li>Add a <em>generous</em> amount of fresh ground black pepper in with the eggs</li>
        <li>Check on Guanciale, flip them over or adjust heat if required (the objective here is to crisp them and extract all the fat to help build the sauce on medium to low heat)</li>
        <li>Check on pasta cooking, agitate/stir them if required</li>
        <li>Grab a cheese grater, Pecorino Romano cheese and grate the cheese into the bowl with the eggs</li>
        <li>Add some pasta water too the eggs, mix together and add more or less untill the egg/cheese mixture is almost a sauce like consistency</li>
        <li>Check on Guanciale in the skillet and if they are crispy turn the heat down to the lowest setting</li>
        <li>Using tongs, pull out some of the pasta and give it a taste test so indicate if pasta is done</li>
        <li>When pasta is done, immediately turn heat off on the Guanciale</li>
        <li><em>The next steps are very crucial, heat management is imperative. Too much heat coupled with ineffective stiring will cause the egg/cheese mixture too overcook, turn into "scrambled" eggs and <i>NOT</i> form a sauce</em></li>
        <li>Move skillet containing Guanciale off heat source</li>
        <li>Using tongs remove the pasta from the pot and add to the skillet</li>
        <li>Do not drain or throw away the pasta water, simply place the pot back onto the heat</li>
        <li>Ladle a small amount of the pasta water into the skillet, this is to prevent the egg mixture from cooking into scrambled eggs and the starch in the pasta water also helps build the sauce</li>
        <li>Add egg/cheese mixture into skillet, immediately stir using tongs</li>
        <li>Continue stiring untill egg/cheese mixture turns into a beautiful creamy sauce</li>
        <li>If there isnt enough heat in the skillet, put skillet back onto low heat and stir</li>
        <li>If the is sauce is not saucy enough, ladle some more pasta water and stir</li>
        <li>Plate the carbonara and immediately garnish with ground black pepper and grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
